    <p>A few years ago, during the pandemic, a project similar to this one was formerly made with the  
        <a href="https://supercollider.github.io">SuperCollider</a>programming language.
        Afterwards, there was a urge to distribute it among people e.g. with Google Play, but SuperCollider is rather not suitable 
        for building applications. Therefore, this project uses the <a href="https://juce.com">JUCE</a> library - 
        it enables making apps including audio plugins for all commonly used operating systems!</p>
