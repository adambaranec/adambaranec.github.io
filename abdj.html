       <h2>What is it about?</h2>
       <p>ABDJ serves as a DJ console in a mobile, which is connected to a computer wirelessly.
         It is made for Android and iOS.
       </p>
       <h2>How does it work?</h2>
       <p>This project works with a protocol called OSC - open sound control, capable for sending data from an application to another application within a network.
         In this case, it is going to send data to ABDJ Plugin, which is suitable for the all most used OS - Windows, Mac and Linux.
