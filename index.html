    <h2>Welcome to the NetDJ project</h2>
    <!--Basic description-->
    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <p>This project contains two types: App and Plugin. The App is practically a DJ console in the digital form. <br>
    It controls the Plugin, which has to be installed in a computer with the help of the protocol OSC - open sound control. <br>
    It means that in the App, the IP address of a computer, where the Plugin will be controlled, must be defined. </p>
    <p id="connect">Both mobile (App) and computer (Plugin) have to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network!</p>
    <!--
            <h3>App</h3>

    <h3>Plugin</h3>

    </p>

    <p id="warning">Warning: This project is under construction at the moment. Although it has been not tested<br>
        at some events yet, it is possible that it does not have to work if a Wi-Fi network has poor quality.
